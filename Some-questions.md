1. DevOps Fundamentals
What is DevOps and why is it important?

Difference between Agile and DevOps

CI vs CD vs Continuous Deployment

Key DevOps practices: automation, monitoring, collaboration, etc.

2. Azure DevOps Services
Azure Repos â€“ Git repos, branching strategies, pull requests

Azure Pipelines â€“ CI/CD pipelines, YAML vs Classic, environments

Azure Boards â€“ Work Items, Epics, Features, User Stories

Azure Artifacts â€“ Package management (NuGet, npm, Maven, etc.)

Azure Test Plans â€“ Manual and automated testing

3. CI/CD with Azure Pipelines
Writing and configuring YAML pipelines

Using stages, jobs, steps, templates, and variables

Running unit/integration tests, publishing results

Integrating with Azure, AWS, or Kubernetes

Deployment strategies: blue-green, canary, rolling

Secrets management with Azure Key Vault

Pipeline triggers: CI, PR, scheduled

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform or ARM templates

Using Terraform in Azure Pipelines

Remote backend with Azure Storage Account

Managing secrets and state securely

Common modules and reuse strategies

5. Security and Compliance
Integrating tools like Trivy, SonarQube, or Snyk into pipelines

Preventing insecure images from being pushed (your use case)

Using Azure Policies and Blueprints

RBAC and managing service connections securely

6. Containers & Kubernetes
Building and pushing Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Deploying to AKS using Helm or kubectl

GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux

Handling rollbacks, scaling, health checks

7. Monitoring and Logging
Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights

Setting up alerts and dashboards

8. Real-world Scenarios
